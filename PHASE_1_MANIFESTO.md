- [ ] Phase 1 Manifesto: Foundation & Scaffolding (Antibody)

**Immediate Objective**: Setup the dual-directory structure for the React (Vite) client and Node.js (Express) server.

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- [x] **PJ-SC-01**: `client/` (React) and `server/` (Express) directories exist.
- [x] **PJ-SC-02**: Core dependencies are installed and `npm run dev` (or equivalent) could potentially start on both ends.

## 🚧 Phase Boundaries
- **IN SCOPE**:
    - Directory creation.
    - Package initialization.
    - Basic dependency installation (Vite, Express, Socket.io).
- **OUT OF SCOPE**:
    - Socket logic.
    - Arithmetic engine (Solver).
    - Game UI components.
    - Database/Storage.
